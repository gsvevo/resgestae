# Res Gestae storymap      

This storymap narrates some passages from the famous self-celebratory inscription that the Emperor Augustus wrote for his funerary monument. There are many copies of this inscription, both in Latin and Greek, which reinforces the idea that the main purpose was to spread Augustus' ideas throughout the Empire. The focus of this storymap are the chapters emphasizing the 'foreign policy' successes of Augustus' reign.

After an introductory scene, the next one shows, through an animation, the extent of the naval exploration during Augustus' principate.
